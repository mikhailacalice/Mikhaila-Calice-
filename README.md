#Project proposal description:

## I propose to analyze the relationship between public perceptions of ai-based algorithmic news bias and political ideology. I plan to do so using a U.S. national survey of 2,700 adults on perceptions of AI technology, collected between February and March 2020. Specifically, within the survey is embedded an experiment to test source ideology on perceptions of algorithmic media bias.  From the results of this experiment, I aim to answer the following research question: 

  ## R1: Does partisan identification impact perceptions of news bias, based on partisan-alignment of the message source?

## This project is what I am working on for my LSC 875 seminar course, as well as part of the research group I am part of.
